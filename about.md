Hi everyone - hope you're doing well!

My name is Jonathan Erdmann and I develop the content of this blog as a hobby in my spare time. In an ideal world, the ideas developed here would allow me to retire early, but more realistically my intent is to achieve a long-term positive return in the context of sports betting - regardless of how small that margin may be. 

I am an aerospace engineer by educational background, with about thirteen years within the industry where I've generally worked on fifth generation fighter aircraft. I'm currently an engineering manager in the same domain and enjoy learning more about the people side of the trade. Outside of the aerospace industry, I've also received an M.A. in Quantitative Finance and briefly worked for a marketing firm as a senior data scientist. I'll be finishing up my second graduate degree in engineering management with an emphasis in computational math as soon as the pandemic allows me a bit more time to study.

In my personal life, I'm a lucky husband to my wife Trish and a proud father to my son Harrison. While the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, I'll be working from home and taking care of my son - in addition to doing most of the cooking and cleaning (ask me about my new baking skills). I'm always down for an online chess game so long as the move frequency is no quicker than one move per day.

If you'd like to reach out, please feel free to send me an email to [optimizedBets@tuta.io](mailto:optimizedBets@tuta.io) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanerdmann/).

Cheers,

Jonathan
