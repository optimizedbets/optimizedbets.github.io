#### Game Description

* There are two potential participants in this game.

* The coin flipper has a limitless amount of money and is responsible for flipping the coin.

* The bettor selects either heads or tails.

* The game costs $1 to play.

* If the bettor correctly selects the side of the coin resulting from the flip, the bettor wins $1 in addition to being returned the original bet.

* Because the ratio of money won to the money wagered is $1 to $1, the payout odds offered by this game are 1:1.

* If the bettor did not correctly select the side of the coin resulting from the flip, no money is returned to the bettor.

#### Assumptions

* Coin tosses are fair such that the probability of a flip resulting in heads or tails are both 50%.

* The coin never lands on its side.

* The bettor begins play with $100 in capital.

#### Outcomes

* If the bettor predicted the first flip correctly, the bettor now has $101 : $100 capital - $1 to play + $1 returned + $1 won = $101.

* If the bettor failed to predict correctly, the bettor now has $99: $100 capital - $1 to play + $0 returned + $0 won = $99.
