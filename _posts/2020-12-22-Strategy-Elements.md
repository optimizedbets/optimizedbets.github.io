#### Fact Statements:

1. A potential sports bet is described by the possible outcomes of the underlying competition and the associated payouts to a bettor should those outcomes occur.
2. Payouts which do not accurately reflect the likelihood that the associated outcome occurs imply that a subset of potential bets are undervalued or overvalued.

#### Assumptions:

1. Undervalued potential bets exist.
2. The probability of competitive outcomes can be estimated (or consumed) by a bettor.

#### Objective:

**Define a betting strategy which allocates capital as a function of the payouts and probabilities of potential sports bets and yields a positive return.**

#### Implementation:

1. Establish a mathematical description of a sports betting strategy.
2. Establish a method to accurately estimate or consume the probability of sports competition.
3. Establish a risk-averse method for allocating capital towards undervalued sports bets.

#### Strategy Elements:

1. Undervalued potential bets exist where the expected value of wagering on the given bet is positive.
2. Given the probability of winning a favorable bet and the associated payout, an optimal value of capital to wager can be determined.
3. Given a set of probabilities and payouts associated with favorable bets, a set of optimal values of capital to wager on each can be determined.
